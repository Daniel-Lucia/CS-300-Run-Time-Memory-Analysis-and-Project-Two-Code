# CS 300 Run Time Memory Analysis and Project Two Code

This repo contains code, a run-time memory analysis, and pseudocode from my time in the Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design course. This course focused on creating efficient software by analyzing and implementing fundamental data structures like vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees. We used C++ to solve problems, focusing on algorithm design, time/space complexity, and sorting/searching techniques. One of the problems we were solving was creating a working code that would sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. The first project focused on making pseudocode for the final project, and the final project was creating the working code planned out in the pseudocode.
