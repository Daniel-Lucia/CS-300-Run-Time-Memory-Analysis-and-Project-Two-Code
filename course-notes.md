# Run-Time-Memory-Analysis-and-Project-Two-Code
This repository contains my run-time and memory analysis and project two cpp file.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The probem we were solving was creating working code that will sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. The first project focused on making psuedocode for the program and the second project was creating the working code for the program.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I ended up creating a Binary Search Tree for my program. Before this course I didn't realize that data structures are all around us. It is much easier to put items into a data structure than writing redundant, repetitive code. The run time for data structures is much less than if we try to do it a different way.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Trial and error and reviewing my feedback helped tremendously for this project. My first version of the BTS was not that great but after reviewing my feedback and doing a little trial and error that help me fix the issues I had.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has challenged me to think about the way I interpret and produce programs. I have a new appreciation for psuedocode and the algorithms we learned are extremely helpful while producing a program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This has by far been the most challenging project I have worked on. This project has tested me coding skills more than any course has so far. I have also been made more conscious of how important adaptable, maintainable, and readable programs are while coding. This course has definitely pushed me to work on that more with every assignment.
